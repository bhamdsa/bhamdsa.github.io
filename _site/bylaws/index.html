  <h1>BIRMINGHAM DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA BYLAWS</h1>
  <article>
    <p>TODO: Get bylaws from Birmingham DSA for this page</p>

<p><em>Drafted by Mark S. Alper and Russell Weiss-Irwin, August 2016</em>
<strong>AMENDED</strong> September 2019
<strong>AMENDED</strong> June 20, 2020
<strong>AMENDED</strong> December 19, 2020
<strong>AMENDED</strong> March 10, 2021</p>

<h2 id="article-i-name">ARTICLE I. NAME</h2>
<p>The name of this organization shall be Central New Jersey Democratic Socialists of America (“CNJ DSA”), a local chapter affiliate (chapter) of Democratic Socialists of America (“DSA”). The jurisdiction of CNJ DSA shall consist of the following counties: Mercer, Middlesex, Somerset, and Hunterdon.</p>

<h2 id="article-ii-purpose">ARTICLE II. PURPOSE</h2>
<p><strong>Section 1.0 Primary goals and objectives</strong></p>

<p>A. Providing a means by which members and supporters of Democratic Socialists of
America can participate in the life of our organization;</p>

<p>B. Openly educating and advocating for democratic socialism in our geographic area;</p>

<p>C. Actively engaging in progressive movements and struggles in Central New Jersey which
are consistent with our values and vision for a democratic and humane society free from repression and exploitation. This includes, but is not limited to, the struggles against racism, sexism, and ableism, while supporting positive and affirming identity movements, including feminism and transgender equality; supporting measures to defend and sustain the environment, which is constantly put at risk by the ceaseless drive for corporate profits; and advocating for the demilitarization of US foreign policy and a world free of nuclear weapons;</p>

<p>D. Supporting other DSA chapters and organizing committees in New Jersey and
surrounding areas to the greatest extent possible; and</p>

<p>E. Participating in the national campaigns and projects of the national DSA.
DSA, as an organization, is proud of our diversity, commitment to democracy, and the pluralism which is at the heart of our organization. Differences between members are respected and, when discussed, a spirit of fraternity and comradeship is maintained. We believe socialism represents the fullest extension of democracy, and that includes the right of all to express their views in an atmosphere that promotes participation and peace of mind. We are not a political party nor do we have a “party line.” We are united by our belief that capitalism is detrimental to living a genuinely free, authentic, and dignified life, just as it is destructive of our health, wellbeing, and environment.</p>

<h2 id="article-iii-membership">ARTICLE III. MEMBERSHIP</h2>
<p><strong>Section 1.0 Eligibility</strong></p>

<p>A. Membership in CNJ DSA is extended to any DSA member who has paid dues to the
national office or has requested a hardship waiver and resides in the geographic area served by the chapter. A CNJ DSA member (“member”) is encouraged to participate in activities of the national, chapter, and applicable branch organization but is not required to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2.0 Resignation of CNJ DSA membership</strong></p>

<p>A. A member may resign their membership with DSA by submitting a letter of resignation.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3.0 Revocation of CNJ DSA membership</strong></p>

<p>A. Membership may be revoked for the following reasons:
Non-payment of dues (unless a hardship waiver has been requested);
Engaging in the harassment or violating the civil rights of another member(s);
Advocating violence or terrorism;
Disrupting meetings;
Being under the discipline of another organization (e.g., “vanguardist” or “democratic
centralist”) organization.
A member may also be removed or suspended at the decision of the chapter’s Harassment and Grievance Officers. These suspensions and expulsions may be appealed to the National organization, or the HGOs of a partner DSA chapter, as outlined in CNJ-DSA’s Harassment and Grievance policy.</p>

<p>B. If a member is to be removed from membership for any reason other than their
resignation, they shall be notified by the Steering Committee after a majority of the Steering Committee votes to remove the member. The member shall have the right to defend themselves in front of the membership and shall only be removed following a two-thirds vote of members present at the defense.</p>

<p><strong>ARTICLE IV. DUES AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT</strong></p>

<p>Annual dues shall be paid to the DSA national office. Members may also choose to contribute funds directly to the chapter.</p>

<p>D. A branch has the right to dissolve itself by majority vote of the branch.</p>

<p>E. The establishment of branches does not prevent members within that branch from
participating in chapter activity outside of their branch, nor does it prevent members from organizing informally without going through the branch application process.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3.0 Branch dissolution</strong></p>

<p>A. A branch that holds no meetings for three months will be considered dissolved. Re- establishing the branch requires that interested members go through the branch application process again.</p>

meeting.</p>

<h2 id="article-ix-committees-and-working-groups">Article IX. Committees and Working Groups</h2>
<p><strong>Section 1.0 Definition and Purpose</strong></p>

<p>In order to more effectively organize to achieve its mission and objectives, CNJ DSA may establish committees and working groups.
Committees may be established for the purpose of organizing around issues before the formation of a formal working group. A committee may also perform specific functions for the chapter (e.g., socialist feminism, design, marketing and communication, public outreach, liaison to other organizations, political education, etc.). Committees are internal-facing to support CNJ DSA’s organizing.
Working groups may be established for the purpose of organizing action around issues or projects (e.g., housing, immigration, socialist feminism, etc.) that fall under the purview of CNJ DSA. Working groups are external-facing to support CNJ DSA’s public campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2.0 Creation of Committee</strong></p>

<p>Members who wish to form a committee must submit a proposed charter that includes:
A group name and a mission statement which includes the goals and objectives of the committee
An initial strategy for achieving the stated objectives
Must include meeting frequency
Must include a timeline for objectives
Must include strategy for outreach internally in CNJ DSA
Must include communication methods, whether email or other methods
Proposed charters for committees must include a statement of whether the proposed committee is to be a standing committee of indefinite duration or a temporary committee to expire at a time certain or upon the occurrence of a specified event.
Whether the committee intends to be formed as a means to build support and infrastructure for a working group.</p>

<p>A list of at least five prospective members (including two who are designated as Coordinators) signed by those members. The duties of the Coordinators include delegating the responsibilities of the committee (not executing all responsibilities themselves.)
If it is anticipated that the proposed committee will seek authorization to expend the chapter’s funds, a short explanation of the anticipated use of those funds and an estimate of the amount to be spent. If the amount of funds needed is less than $50, expenditures may be authorized by the Steering Committee. The funds may include printing costs for literature, supplies for holding a meeting, etc. For a proposal of funds over $50, the committee would apply for authorization for chapter funds by majority vote at a chapter meeting.
Membership in committees should be open to all members in good standing but if there is a reason that the committee is not open to all members, the charter must include the reason. Reasons might include membership based on gender identification or race.</p>

<p>Prior to the formation of the committee, it should referred to as “Proposed Committee”
A proposed committee shall be recognized and chartered with the approval of a majority of the votes cast at a General chapter meeting. Coordinators of the committee must send the charter to the Chapter SC so the charter can be published on the agenda or announced to the membership at least 7 days prior to the meeting.</p>

<p>After a committee is chartered, responsibilities include:
A representative from the committee must provide a report-back to the general membership at the monthly General chapter meeting.
Social media accounts for committees may only be started after the committee has been given a charter by the general membership.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2.1 Creation of a Working Group</strong></p>

<p>Members who wish to form a working group must submit a proposed charter that includes:
A group name and a mission statement which includes the goals and objectives of the working group. If there is interest in forming a working group, members are encouraged to start by forming a committee.</p>

<p>An initial strategy for achieving the stated objectives
Must include proposed meeting frequency. If the working group plans on holding outward facing events, should include proposed frequency of events
Must include a timeline for objectives and any proposed campaigns
Must include strategy for outreach, internally in CNJ DSA and/or externally
Must include communication methods, internally in CNJ DSA and/or externally</p>

<p>A list of at least ten prospective members (including two who are designated as Coordinators) signed by those members. The duties of the Coordinators include delegating the responsibilities of the working group (not executing all responsibilities themselves.)
Working groups may decide how they will create an infrastructure and if there will be a steering committee.
At least five of the members should be trained on organizing and planning strategic campaigns. CNJ DSA Steering Committee must provide opportunities for trainings on organizing and planning strategic campaigns.
It is strongly recommended that there is a procedure for onboarding new members; providing training on working group activities and organizing skills; communication methods; fundraising if funds are needed (other than general administration costs like printing and meeting supplies); outreach to coalition partners; record-keeping; social media and report-backs.)</p>

<p>If it is anticipated that the proposed working group will seek authorization to expend the chapter’s funds, a short explanation of the anticipated use of those funds and an estimate of the amount to be spent. If the amount of funds needed is less than $50, expenditures may be authorized by the Steering Committee. The funds may include printing costs for literature, supplies for holding a meeting, etc. For a proposal of funds over $50, the working group would apply for authorization for chapter funds by majority vote at a chapter meeting.</p>

<p>Prior to the formation of the working group, it should referred to as “Proposed Working Group”
A proposed working group shall be recognized and chartered with the approval of a majority of the votes cast at a monthly General or Special meeting. Coordinators of the working group must send the charter to the Chapter SC so the charter can be published on the agenda or announced to the membership at least 7 days prior to the meeting.</p>

<p>After a working group is chartered, responsibilities include:
A representative from the working group must provide a report-back to the general membership at the monthly General chapter meeting.
Social media accounts for working groups may only be started after the working group has been given a charter by the general membership.
Membership in working groups is to be open to all members in good standing.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3. Membership and Election of Coordinators</strong></p>

<p>The founders of a proposed committee or working group must designate two temporary Coordinators. Temporary Coordinators will serve once the group is chartered; an election for committee leadership must then be held at no later than the second meeting following ratification. Ratified committees and working groups must elect at least two Coordinators and may also elect someone to serve as their deputy. Terms will last either 6 months or one year. Unless no candidates who do not identify as male choose to stand in the election, at least one of the Coordinators elected must not identify as male.</p>

<p>All Coordinators are encouraged to attend CNJ DSA Steering Committee meetings.
In the interest of sharing leadership opportunities and elevating rank and file members, Coordinators of committees and working groups (including steering committee) cannot chair more than one committee or working group unless no other eligible members wish to run.</p>

<p><strong>Section 4. Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>The members of a committee or working group are responsible for executing their respective body’s strategy in fulfillment of its objectives. Coordinators are responsible for organizing their respective body’s members, running meetings, acting as liaisons to the Steering Committee, and serving as the body’s points of contact to the CNJ DSA membership.</p>

<p>Committees and Working Groups should keep official records of meeting dates, attendance, and meeting notes, which must be made available to the CNJ DSA membership.</p>

<p><strong>Section 5. Review, Modification, and Dissolution</strong></p>

<p>A committee’s or working group’s activities shall be reviewed by the Steering Committee at the Regular Steering Committee meetings. Committees and working groups shall report on their activities to the CNJ DSA membership at the monthly General chapter meeting.</p>

<p>Existing committees and working groups may amend their charters with the approval of a majority of the votes cast at a monthly General or Special meeting. Proposed amendments to a committee’s or working group’s charter must be published on the agenda or announced to the membership at least 7 days prior to the meeting.</p>

<p>Committees that are chartered as temporary committees shall dissolve automatically upon the expiration of the certain time or occurrence of the particular event specified in their charter. All other committees shall continue in existence indefinitely unless dissolved by a majority of the votes cast at a monthly General or Special meeting. If the Coordinators of a committee step down  or their term ends, and no one chooses to step up in an election for replacements, the committee will be dissolved.</p>

<p>Working groups shall also continue in existence indefinitely unless dissolved by a majority of the votes cast at a Regular, Special, or General meeting, or by the resignation or unanimous consent of the working group’s active members. If the Coordinators of a working group step down or their term ends, and no one chooses to step up in an election for replacements, the working group will be dissolved.</p>

<p>Upon dissolution, the member(s) maintaining custody of the committee’s or working group’s records shall provide copies of those records to the Secretary.</p>

<p><strong>Section 6.</strong>
Finally, each committee and working group shall present a report on their activities to the general membership of CNJ DSA twice annually. This report shall be drafted and made available to the general membership one week prior to the meeting at which it is to be presented. This report should inform the chapter of the progress of the committee or working group’s major efforts, and discuss both what successes the committee or working group has found, as well as analyze what has not worked well. The general membership will provide advice and constructive feedback to the committee or working group to help improve operations and to better align the committee or working group’s efforts with the overall base-building strategy of the chapter.</p>

<p>This report should also contain a rough plan of the committee or working group’s activities for the following 6-month period. The committee or working group may present a set of asks or tasks which the committee or working group could use assistance from the general membership of the chapter, either on a short term or ongoing basis, and use this report as an opportunity for recruitment.</p>

<p>Once discussion of the committee or working group’s report has concluded, the general assembly must approve the report and affirm that the committee or working group’s goals for the upcoming period align with the chapter’s mission. If the general assembly does not approve of the goals, the committee or working group must make an amended plan to address issues raised and present this plan at the next month’s general assembly meeting for approval by the general assembly. A committee or working group whose 6-month plans are repeatedly rejected by the assembly may be subject to a vote by the assembly to dissolve the committee or working group as described above.</p>

<h2 id="article-xi--harassment-and-grievance-policy">ARTICLE XI.  Harassment and Grievance Policy</h2>

<p>Central NJ Democratic Socialists (“CNJ DSA”) is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, race, or class, to organize without fear of harassment. We aim to design a space that amplifies and protects marginalized voices by developing a policy for reporting grievances based on the harassment policy Resolution 33 which was passed at the DSA National Convention in August 2017, while adding several extra protections not guaranteed by the Resolution and an eye towards restorative justice, healing, and victim support.</p>

<p>DSA’s national harassment policy can be found at: https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/harassment-policy-resolution-33/</p>

<p><strong>Section 1.0 Policy Overview</strong></p>

<p>A. Scope Of This Policy</p>

<p>Prohibited behavior. Members shall not engage in harassment on the basis of
sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, race, color, religion, national origin, class, age, or profession.
Harassing or abusive behavior, such as unwelcome attention, inappropriate or offensive remarks, slurs, or jokes, physical or verbal intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact or proximity, and other verbal and physical conduct constitute harassment when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a member’s continued affiliation with DSA;</li>
  <li>Submission or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for organizational decisions affecting such individual; or</li>
  <li>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating a hostile environment
interfering with an individual’s capacity to organize within DSA.</li>
  <li>Other protected classes. Harassment based on categories not encompassed by those listed section (a) will be evaluated at the discretion of the Harassment and Grievance Officer (“HGO”) and Steering Committee (“SC”) representatives.</li>
  <li>Members may also file grievances not directed at a specific individual, such as hostile environments and other systemic issues. Investigation in these cases shall center and seek to support the grievant in determining the appropriate remedy.</li>
</ul>

<p>B. Reporting Harassment</p>

<p>Complaints. Members may follow the standard complaint process as set out in
the following sections if they believe they have been harassed by another member.
Time Limitations. There will be no time limits requiring the grievant to file a report within any amount of time after the alleged harassment has occurred.</p>

<p>C. This document describes the complaint procedure adopted by CNJ DSA. If any
grievant does not feel that their concerns can be adequately addressed by CNJ DSA, they may pursue a complaint with National Grievance Officers and the NPC without going through the Chapter procedure first.</p>

<p>D. The SC of CNJ DSA will publicize this policy and make HGO contact information
available to membership as often as possible, including, but not limited to: Chapter- wide emails, meeting agendas, social media, and online chapter communication platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2.0 Harassment and Grievance Officers</strong></p>

<p>A. Membership shall elect two members to serve as HGOs. Due to the gendered nature
of many harassment complaints at the National level, no more than one HGO may be cismale. HGOs may not be SC members, but may run for Steering Committee when their HGO term has ended.
Election of HGOs will follow standard procedures outlined in the Chapter
bylaws. HGOs will serve staggered two-year terms.</p>

<p>B. HGO Responsibilities</p>
<ul>
  <li>Receive, acknowledge receipt of, and archive grievant reports</li>
  <li>Contact the accused to notify them of the accusations, request their written
response, and archive any written response</li>
  <li>Conduct any necessary investigation of the claim</li>
  <li>Present their findings to the Steering Committee with a written report.</li>
  <li>If necessary, take disciplinary action and report the discipline administered to
the Steering Committee.</li>
  <li>Present an anonymized version of the report to deliver to membership after conclusion of an investigation. The HGOs may make exceptions to anonymity in service of the restorative justice process, in the case of any member who has been removed from the chapter permanently or temporarily as a result of the investigation.</li>
  <li>Compile a yearly report that details:</li>
  <li>How many reports were made</li>
  <li>How many were taken to the formal disciplinary process</li>
  <li>How many disciplinary actions were taken</li>
  <li>Any recommended changes for making the reporting system effective,
preferably informed by survey of membership</li>
</ul>

<p>C. Removal of an HGO.</p>

<p>An HGO may resign at any time.
If an HGO fails to perform their duties fairly, diligently, and ethically, there may be cause for removal. The SC may remove an HGO by majority vote after the HGO is informed of the cause for removal and given the opportunity to self- advocate to the SC.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3.0 Complaints</strong></p>

<p>A. Making A Complaint
The SC will establish a confidential email for submitting complaints, which is
monitored only by the HGOs. Login information will be changed at each new term or sooner.
The SC will make a complaint form available upon request that is linked to the
HGO email.</p>

<p>On the form, the grievant may have the option to submit the complaint as an
emergency, in which case an expedited investigation will take place.
If a grievant objects to both HGOs viewing a complaint, they may contact one
HGO directly and confidentially.
The identities of all involved parties will remain confidential to everyone who is
not an HGO, including the SC (and at the request of the grievant, disclosure may also be denied to the HGO not currently investigating the case), pending the outcome of the investigation, except as necessary for a complete investigation.
Multiple complaints against one person may be consolidated into a single
investigation. Any grievant may veto this consolidation.
Grievants have the right to a proxy or representative of their choosing to speak
on their behalf and act as the primary contact with HGOs throughout the investigation.</p>

<p>B. Recusal</p>

<p>An HGO is required to recuse themselves from any investigation involving either
a complainant or accused who is a close friend or family member of the HGO, or with whom the HGO has an extensive working relationship or past or present romantic or sexual relationship. An HGO should also recuse themselves if other conflicts would present an appearance of impropriety. Such potential conflicts may be raised by any party or by any member of leadership at the outset of an investigation and may be determined by other</p>

<p><strong>Section 4.0 Responding To A Complaint</strong></p>

<p>A. Informal conversation/mediation</p>

<p>Some complaints may be resolved without the need for a formal grievance
process. In this case, there may be an informal conversation between parties mediated by an HGO.
In an informal mediation,
all parties must attend voluntarily and express a desire for resolution;
the HGO remains neutral;
each person has the ability to state their perspectives uninterrupted;
the mediator may follow the general structure of affective questioning; and
the goal is to find a solution to the conflict that is primarily developed and
mutually agreed upon by all parties.
a final summary of the conversation is made available to the SC, but the SC
does not participate in the results of the mediation.</p>

<p>B. Filing Official Grievance.</p>

<p>After a written report has been submitted, whether
through the email hotline or otherwise:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The HGO(s) will contact the grievant within three days to acknowledge receipt of
the complaint and set up a conversation.</li>
  <li>The HGO(s) will contact the accused member within five days to notify them that a report has been filed against them and request a written response to the report either affirming or denying its substance.</li>
  <li>The accused will submit their written response within seven days of being
notified. If the accused fails to meet this deadline or request an extension, the HGO will consult the grievant first regarding appropriate disciplinary measures.</li>
  <li>If the accused denies the substance of the report, the HGO will set up a
conversation. The HGO overseeing the dispute will have the option to investigate the report by:
    <ol>
      <li>interviewing other members with direct knowledge of the substance of the
report;</li>
      <li>requesting documentation from either the grievant or accused or any other
parties directly involved; or</li>
      <li>employing any and all other means deemed necessary, with the utmost
respect for the confidentiality and emotional needs of the parties, within a time period not to exceed ten days.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When victims are closed out of the disciplinary process, they are re-victimized. In
order to avoid replicating the oppressive structures of our current judicial system, before reaching a conclusion, the HGO(s) will schedule a final conversation with the grievant following the general guidelines of post-conflict affective questioning. The purpose is to amplify the voices of victims and consider their needs and perspectives when moving forward with disciplinary action or otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>C. The HGO(s) responsible for investigating the dispute will determine whether the
report is credible and take appropriate disciplinary action, if necessary, as soon as practicable, without exceeding thirty days. The HGO(s) may notify SC of the accuser’s report and its substance at any time after the report is filed, but must give written notice to both the accuser and the accused member before doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Section 5.0 Remedies and penalties</strong></p>

<p>A. Determinations</p>

<p>All reports will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the HGO(s) associated with the accuser’s reporting channel. The ultimate determination in each case will be made by the HGO(s).</p>

<p>B. Standard for Determining if a Report is Credible</p>

<p>The HGOs will find a factual allegation is “credible” if it more-likely-than-not
occurred.</p>

<p>C. Remedies and Penalties</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the HGOs find a factual allegation to be credible, they are authorized to carry
out disciplinary action, which may include:
    <ol>
      <li>A formal discussion between the accused and the HGOs and/or Steering
Committee to develop a plan for repairing the harm;</li>
      <li>Suspension from committee meetings and other chapter or organizational
events;</li>
      <li>Removal from chapter committee(s);</li>
      <li>Removal from the chapter; and</li>
      <li>Any and all other relief deemed necessary and just by the HGO(s).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The SC will enforce any suspensions or expulsions in accordance with chapter
procedures.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 6.0 Appeals Process</strong></p>

<p>A. Either party may appeal the final result of the grievance by filling out an appeal
form, available upon request from an HGO or the Steering Committee. Appeals must be filed within thirty days of receiving written notice of the decision. The limited grounds for appeal are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Either party believes the behavior was not interpreted using the standards for
harassment set out in Section 1a;</li>
  <li>Procedural errors, misconduct, or conflicts of interest affected the fairness of the
outcome; and</li>
  <li>The remedy or penalty determined by the HGOs was disproportionate to the
violation committed</li>
</ol>

<p>B. Appeals will be heard by the Harassment and Grievance Officers of North or South
Jersey DSA, provided they have adopted a policy agreeing to this arrangement. They will follow Central Jersey’s grievance policy in deciding the appeal.</p>

<p>C. Nothing in this policy can limit a member’s right to file an appeal directly with the
national organization.</p>

<p><strong>Section 7.0 Retaliation</strong></p>

<p>This policy prohibits retaliation against any member for bringing a complaint of harassment pursuant to this policy. This policy also prohibits retaliation against a person who assists someone with a complaint of harassment, or participates in any manner in an investigation or resolution of a complaint of discrimination or harassment. Retaliatory behaviors includes threats, intimidation, reprisals, and/or adverse actions related to organizing. If any party to the complaint believes there has been retaliation, they may inform the HGO who will determine whether to factor the retaliation into the original complaint, or treat it as an individual incident.</p>

<h2 id="article-xii-amendments-to-the-bylaws">ARTICLE XII. AMENDMENTS TO THE BYLAWS</h2>
<p>These bylaws may be amended by a two-thirds vote at a regular chapter meeting. Any amendment that is introduced at a meeting must have an online poll that will be opened by the following chapter email and must remain open for one week.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">APPENDIX</h2>
<p><strong>Rules of Order</strong></p>

<p>Rules and procedure for meetings, as adapted from the rules of the Portland General Membership Branch of the IWW.</p>

<p>Decisions are made by a majority vote of present chapter members in good standing. A majority is more than half of those voting—that is, there are more yes votes than no votes.</p>

<p>Meetings should be businesslike and efficient. The tone should be one of mutual respect. Insults and personal attacks will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Members may speak only when recognized by the chair. When speaking in the meeting, address the group as a whole. No discussion is permitted unless a main motion is pending, in which case only comments germane to the pending motion are in order. This requirement may be relaxed to allow for free discussion, for example after an educational presentation, by a majority vote or allotment on the agenda.</p>

<p><strong>The Agenda</strong></p>

<p>An agenda must be approved as the first order of business at any meeting. Times may be assigned to agenda items. If one agenda item is pending when the time for the following item comes, the former must be immediately put to a vote, unless a motion to dispose of it in some other way is introduced (e.g. tabling, postponing, or referring), or the agenda is amended to allow for more time.</p>

<p>If there are any motions that have been carried over to the current meeting from a previous one, they should be included under the heading of unfinished business.</p>

<p><strong>Making a Main Motion</strong></p>

<p>A Main Motion concerns business to be carried out by the group. There may be only one main motion on the floor at a given time.
The motion is stated, beginning with: “I move that…” The motion should be clear and concise. If the motion is not seconded it dies.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion and Amendment</strong></p>

<p>If the motion is seconded, it is repeated by the chair, to establish the exact wording. At this point the motion is discussed. No member may speak twice on a motion until each member that wishes to speak has been heard. Possible exception to this rule would be to allow the maker of the motion to explain and clarify. No member may speak for more than five minutes at a time.</p>

<p>Any member may move to amend the main motion during this discussion. Such motions must also be seconded, and are open for discussion. If the amendment passes a majority vote, discussion resumes on the newly-revised main motion. The original maker of the main motion may not unilaterally make or accept a “friendly amendment” to the motion—once it has been stated by the chair, a motion “belongs” to the assembled meeting as a whole, and can only be amended by vote or unanimous consent.</p>

<p><strong>Voting</strong></p>

<p>A vote on the main motion is taken when discussion is completed. A voice vote or uncounted show of hands will usually be sufficient in cases where the result is clear or uncontroversial, but any member may call for a counted vote without being recognized by the chair. If the call is seconded, a counted vote shall be taken. A secret ballot may be required by a majority vote.
Often, the chair can seek unanimous consent, by asking if there is any objection to the motion. If any member objects, a vote must be taken. If there is no objection, the motion passes.</p>

<p>Discussion may also be closed by a motion to call the question, which requires a 2/3 vote. If this motion passes, the chapter immediately moves to a vote on the pending motion.</p>

<p>Once a motion has been adopted, it may be rescinded or amended by a majority vote at the same meeting, but only if the motion to rescind or amend is made by somebody who voted in favor of the original motion. This rule protects the chapter from repeated reversals if a majority temporarily becomes a slight minority—if one or two people leave the room after a long vote, for example. This restriction does not carry across meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Procedural Points and Motions</strong></p>

<p>Points of Procedure and Procedural Motions speak to the process of the meeting. They are in order at any time and must be dealt with right away, before going on with the meeting.</p>

<p><strong>Procedural Motions:</strong></p>

<p>A Procedural Motion must be seconded and voted on by the group. This should be done quickly, so as not to distract from the main business at hand.
These motions require a majority vote to pass:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To lay on the table (Temporarily set aside a main motion to deal with a pressing item of business. The original motion is taken up again once the interrupting one has been disposed of.)</li>
  <li>To postpone indefinitely (Kills the main motion)</li>
  <li>To postpone to a certain time</li>
  <li>To refer (to committee or wherever)</li>
  <li>To adjourn</li>
  <li>To recess (take a break)</li>
  <li>To overrule the chair</li>
  <li>To replace the chair</li>
  <li>To divide the question (separate the main motion into several main motions to be taken up sequentially. This can only be done if each of the proposed parts can stand on its own independently.)</li>
  <li>To consider by paragraph or section (each section of a long motion is opened up to discussion and amendment, one at a time. Then, the whole motion is open to discussion and amendment before a final vote.)</li>
  <li>To enter executive session (only chapter members and guests approved by majority vote are permitted to attend)</li>
</ul>

<p>These require a 2/3 vote:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To call the question</li>
  <li>To censure a member</li>
  <li>To expel (must be preceded by a motion to censure, except in case of immediate danger. This motion expels the individual from the meeting, not the organization.)</li>
  <li>To limit or extend the limits of debate (to increase or decrease the number and length of speeches per member, or to set a time that discussion of a motion must end)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Points of Procedure:</strong></p>

<p>The maker raises their hand and speaks out: “Point of Procedure” (or “Point of Order”). The chair must recognize the member immediately.</p>

<p>Point of Personal Privilege: It’s too hot, too stuffy, can’t hear the speaker, etc. Very useful for clarifying what is going on. If it’s unclear to you what’s happening, you’re probably not the only one.</p>

<p>Point of Procedure (or Order): This is a suggestion as to how to carry out the business better, or an objection to the way the rules have been followed or interpreted. It is ruled on by the chair. The ruling can be challenged and the point made into a motion. Don’t get too carried away here, please.</p>

<p><strong>The Chair</strong></p>

<p>The chair should aim to serve as an impartial facilitator of the group decision-making process. As such, they cannot make motions or participate in discussion. They cannot vote unless their vote would change the outcome, or if the vote is by secret ballot.</p>

<p>If the chair really needs to do these things, they must pass the chair on to another member for the duration of that item of business. This shouldn’t happen very often.</p>

<p>The chair is to oversee the process of the meeting to insure that the following criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
  <li>That the business moves along quickly.</li>
  <li>The chair must keep track of the time. A timekeeper may be appointed by the chair if needed.</li>
  <li>That the Agenda is followed.</li>
  <li>That each item of business is taken care of.</li>
  <li>That each member who wishes to participate is encouraged and given that opportunity.</li>
  <li>That none dominates the meeting and speaks excessively at the expense of the others.</li>
  <li>That the meeting is carried out in accordance with the rules and procedures agreed upon by the group.</li>
  <li>That the process is clear, understandable, accessible and transparent to the members. The chair should make sure all members are aware of the pending motion and the effects of any vote before it is taken, and should frequently invite questions about the current item of business.</li>
  <li>That an atmosphere and tone of mutual respect is maintained. The chair, in the name of the group, does not allow disrespect, insult or personal attack in the meeting.</li>
  <li>The chair may not take part in the business of the meeting. They can and should offer suggestions for the sake of clarity and to move the business along. The chair may suggest a motion or procedure, and help members to frame their own motions.</li>
</ul>
