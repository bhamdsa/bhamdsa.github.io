New Brunswick's Rent Control Ordinance regulates annual, allowable rent increases on most rental apartments. (The allowable annual increase for 2022 is 2.8%.) If you are in a regulated unit, your rent cannot be increased more than once in a 12- month period. If you suspect your rent was increased more than allowed, contact the Rent Control Office to file a complaint.

**New Brunswick Department of Housing Inspections:** (732) 745-5075

If you feel that the conditions in your apartment or house are unlivable or dangerous, you can have the local housing inspector inspect the property. However, you should first give the landlord written notice of the problems and an opportunity to repair them before calling the Housing Inspection Department.
